Subject: [PATCH 3/8] kernel: module.c: Force loading of modules that fail
 symbol version checks

- Some kernel changes may break kmi, at which point the kernel will
  refuse to load some vendor modules.
- But certain modules are critical for device startup. If they are
  not successfully loaded, not only can't boot, even can't enter
  recovery mode (because the same kernel is used to start Android
  and start recovery). At this time, user can only flash the stock
  boot image through fastboot. This is very inconvenient for users.
- Therefore, we force the loading of modules that fail the symbol
  version check to ensure that Android / Recovery can start normally.
  But also keep the warning to remind the developer to fix it.
